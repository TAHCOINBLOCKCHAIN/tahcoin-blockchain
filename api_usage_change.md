## What is Tahcoin?

**Tahcoin** is a type of digital money that you can use to send and receive funds over the internet. It operates on a secure network called a **blockchain**, which keeps track of all transactions without charging extra fees.

## What Do You Need?

Before you can send Tahcoin, you need the following:

1. **Your Public Key**: This is like your address where people can send you money.
2. **Your Private Key**: This is your secret password that allows you to access your fundsâ€”keep this safe!
3. **Receiver's Public Key**: The address of the person you want to send money to.
4. **Amount**: How much Tahcoin you want to send.

## Installing PHP

If PHP is not installed on your computer, follow these steps to install it:

### For Windows:

1. **Download PHP**:
   - Go to the [PHP Downloads page](https://windows.php.net/download/).
   - Choose the latest version and download the **Non-Thread Safe** version (usually in a ZIP file).

2. **Extract PHP**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder, e.g., `C:\php`.

3. **Add PHP to System Path**:
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings."
   - Click on "Environment Variables."
   - Under "System variables," find and select the `Path` variable, then click "Edit."
   - Add the path to your PHP folder (e.g., `C:\php`) and click "OK."

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open Command Prompt and type `php -v`. You should see the PHP version information.

### For macOS:

1. **Using Homebrew**:
   - If you donâ€™t have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Install PHP by running:
     ```bash
     brew install php
     ```

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install php
     ```

   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install php
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**:

## The Command

To send Tahcoin using the API, you will use this command:

```
curl -X POST 'https://tahriver.online/api_313.php' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'public_key=your_public_key&private_key=your_private_key&receiver_address=your_receiver_address&amount=0.019990904'
```

### Breaking Down the Command

- **`curl -X api_313.php`**: This part tells your computer to run the program called `api_313.php`, which handles the transaction.
- **`'your_public_key'`**: Replace this with your actual public key (your wallet address).
- **`'your_private_key'`**: Replace this with your actual private key (your secure access key).
- **`'receiver_public_key'`**: Replace this with the public key of the person you want to send money to (their wallet address).
- **`'amount'`**: Specify how much TAH you want to send.

## Example

Letâ€™s say:

- Your public key is `TAH313`
- Your private key is `HER313`
- Your friend's public key is `TAH1999`
- You want to send 9 TAH.

Your command would look like this:

```
curl -X POST 'https://tahriver.online/api_313.php' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-d 'public_key=TAH313&private_key=HER313&receiver_address=TAH1999&amount=9'
```

## Running the Command

1. Open your terminal or command prompt on your computer.
2. Type in the command with your specific information.
3. Press **Enter**.

If everything goes well, you will see a message confirming that your Tahcoin has been sent!

## Important Tips

- **Double-check your keys and amount** before sending any transactions.
- **Keep your private key secure!** Never share it with anyone; itâ€™s essential for protecting your funds.
- If you encounter any issues, consider asking for help from someone knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies.
