# Tahcoin Blockchain

Tahcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on a blockchain network designed to be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The Tahcoin blockchain focuses on providing a seamless experience for users to transact and store their digital currency without incurring transaction fees.

## Key Features of Tahcoin Blockchain

1. **Decentralization**: The Tahcoin blockchain operates on a decentralized network, ensuring resilience and resistance to censorship or single points of failure.

2. **Immutability**: Data stored in the Tahcoin blockchain is secured and made immutable through cryptography. Each block is referenced by a unique string of characters generated by a cryptographic hash function.

3. **Proof-of-Work Consensus**: Tahcoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This mechanism ensures network security and transparent transaction processing.

4. **Block Confirmation**: Transactions on the Tahcoin blockchain require 199 block confirmations to ensure their validity and security.

5. **Block Generation Time**: A new block is generated approximately every 19 seconds, allowing for efficient transaction processing while maintaining network stability.

6. **Mining Rewards**: Miners receive rewards in Tahcoin for successfully mining new blocks, eliminating the need for transaction fees. This approach ensures that users do not waste coins on fees that do not contribute to the network.

7. **Scalability**: The Tahcoin blockchain is designed to be scalable, incorporating features such as parallel processing to handle a high volume of transactions without compromising performance or security.

8. **Security**: Tahcoin employs advanced cryptographic techniques and secure coding practices to protect the network and user funds from malicious attacks and vulnerabilities.
